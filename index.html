                              Indeed, it is normal to seek a refuge that pushes you to put things into perspective and concentrate your life so that you may return to the city refreshed and revitalized. Remember that life is too short to not appreciate the simple joys in life, so go ahead and take that beach excursion to break up the monotony of your everyday routine. Go to areas that make you feel the most at ease and serene, and where you know you'll have a good time.

                            Nasugbu is no stranger to all things big. It is one of the largest municipalities in Batangas in terms of land area, population, and history. It is also home to Central Azucarera Don Pedro, one of biggest sugar producers in the Philippines. But there’s one more thing that it can boast: it is also big on natural wonders.

                      
                        <p>
                            Nasugbu’s town center is set in an agricultural plain, but much of the municipality’s terrain is crumpled with mountains, concealing dozens of pristine coves at their feet. Some of these coves are occupied by privately owned exclusive villages and clubs like the Hamilo Coast, Punta Fuego, and Tali Beach Subdivision. In order to get access to these beaches, you would need to know someone inside or book a house or villa. Fortunately, Nasugbu isn’t only for the rich and powerful. Many public beaches harbor fishing settlements and mid-range resorts that are open to anyone.

                            It is said that a Spanish group leader had asked the woman what the place was called in his native tongue. Through a case of miscommunication, the woman thought that the Spaniard was referring to her rice to which she replied. “Nasubo na po iyan, eh, kaya ganyan” (The rice has been eaten; that is why it is like that). The Spaniard kept repeating the word and nodding his head and introduced the word to his companions. From then on, the village began to be called by that name.

                        As mentioned earlier, Nasugbu is huge. Where you should stay depends on what attraction in particular you would like to see. For example, if you’d like to see Fortune Island, you can go camping on the island itself or stay in the town proper. If it’s Loren Island, find a resort in Calayo Beach. For Layag-layag Beach, Brgy. Papaya is the most ideal.

                       Resorts or hotels. These are the usual accommodations. You know this.
Rented houses. Because much of Nasubu’s jagged coast is occupied by exclusive villages, access is restricted to residents and their guests. Most of these properties are just “rest houses,” which means the owners don’t really stay there. Some owners rent them out to tourists, who are then given access to the beaches and features. Some examples of this arrangement are Pico Sands Hotel and Tali Beach Subdivision.
Homestays. In public beaches like in Calayo and Papaya, there are locals renting out rooms in their homes to tourists for a small fee.
Camp sites. Beaches like Bituin Cove (Angara Cove), Layag Layag Beach, and Fortune Island all allow campers to pitch tents for a fee.
